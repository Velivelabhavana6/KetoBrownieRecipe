        <h2>Ingredients</h2><br>
        <dl>You'll only need a few simple ingredients to make these brownies. The exact measurements are included in the recipe card below.<br>Here's an overview of what you'll need</dl>
        <ul>
        <b><li>Unsalted butter:</b> You can use salted butter and omit the salt.</li>
            <b><li>Dark chocolate: </b>The darker you can go and still enjoy the brownies, the better. I typically use Lindt 70% cacao.</li>
            <b><li>Eggs:</b> I use large eggs in almost all my recipes, this one included.</li>
            <b><li>Sweetener:</b> I use stevia glycerite. You can use a granulated sweetener instead.</li>
            <b><li>Almond flour:</b> You should use blanched, finely ground flour and not a coarse almond meal.</li>
            <b><li>Unsweetened cocoa powder:</b> Natural or Dutch-processed, both work, although I prefer Dutch-processed in this recipe.</li>
            <b><li>Salt:</b> I use Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt.</li>
            <b><li>Baking powder:</b> Gluten-free if needed.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>

        <div id="variations">
        <h2>Variations</h2><br>
        <ul>
            <li>The best way to vary this recipe is to add flavor extracts. Sometimes,I add a teaspoon of vanilla, coconut, almond, or orange extract.Experiment and see what you like best!

            You can also add a handful (about ¼ cup) of chocolate chips or unsalted raw pecans to the batter.</li>
        </ul><br>
        </div><br><br>
        <div id="instructions">
        <h2>Instructions</h2><br>
        <ul>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F. Butter a square 8-inch glass or ceramic (not metal) baking dish.</li>
        <li>In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter and chocolate in 30-second increments, stirring after each microwave session. Microwave just until it's almost melted. Chocolate burns easily</li>
        <li>Allow the mixture to slightly cool, then whisk in the eggs and stevia. Next, whisk in the almond flour and the cocoa powder. Finally, mix in the salt and the baking powder. Mix until the batter is very smooth</li>
        <li>Using a rubber spatula, transfer the mixture to the prepared baking dish, spreading it evenly. Smooth the top out with the spatula.</li>
        <li>Bake until just set, 15-20 minutes. A toothpick inserted in the center should come out with a few moist crumbs, not completely wet or dry. Start checking after 15 minutes. Cool completely in the pan on a wire rack for about 1 hour. Then, cut into 16 squares and serve.</li>
        </ul>
